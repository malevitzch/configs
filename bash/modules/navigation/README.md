# fastup
Implements the alias "cd.. \<x\>" which allows you do go up multiple directories at once, for example
```bash
    cd.. 3
```
will go up three directories. The command can also be used without a number, acting like regular "cd .." in that case.
# cdl
A simple alias "cdl \<dir\>" that basically just executes ls instantly after changing directory, convenient for navigation.

# cdminus
A mapping of "cd-" to "cd -".
