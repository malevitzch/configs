# gd
An alias for 'git diff --stat' which gives you (in my opinion) the most reasonable list of changes you can get through git diff.
# gds
Same as gd but for staged changes.
# gdt
Show both staged and unstaged changes separated by headers.
# gitc
Commit all unstaged changes on tracked files with the message given by user input.
