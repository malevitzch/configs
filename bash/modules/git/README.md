# gd
An alias for 'git diff --stat' which gives you (in my opinion) the most reasonable list of changes you can get through git diff.
# gds
Same as gd but for staged changes.
# gdt
Show both staged and unstaged changes separated by headers.
# gitc
Commit all staged and unstaged changes on tracked files with the message given as parameter.
# gittc
Creates a file and then marks it to be tracked by git through 'git add'. The filename has to be the first argument, the later arguments are passed to the 'touch' command.
