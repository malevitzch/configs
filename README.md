# configs
This repo exists as a convenient storage for my configs for commonly-available linux programs for portability.
Three main modules are currently available, vim, tmux, and bash

# todo:
- possibly add a neovim config? not necessary though
- add basic information for tmux vim and bash in the main README.md
